## Approach
  
  1.Setup my the environment in ubuntu to make ros node 
  2.Collect image data set. Annotate it.
  
  3.Explore custom neural net/ open source frameworks
  
  4.Train the model with obtained cone data
  
  5.Test on given image
  
...and so on but unfortunately could not go beyond step 4
